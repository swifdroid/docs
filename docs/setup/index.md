# Setup

You are on your way of writing real native Swift code for Android.  
It's going to be an interesting journey, so grab a cup of tea and let's begin.

## What You'll Need:
1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
2. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension
3. The [Swift Stream IDE](https://swift.stream/) extension for VSCode

Yeah yeah, that's easy, right?

Your operating system doesn't matter as long as it can run Docker and VSCode.

Anyway, detailed instructions for each OS:

[→ macOS Setup](macos.md)  
[→ Linux Setup](linux.md)  
[→ Windows Setup](windows.md)

Once you have everything set up, head to the [→ Application Getting Started](../app/getting-started.md) guide to create your first SwifDroid project!
