# Welcome to Swift for Android

Swift for Android is an open-source project and part of the [Swift Stream](https://github.com/swiftstream) family.

It’s built **by developers, for developers – with love**, to make creating Android apps in Swift simple and enjoyable.

This project brings the power and expressiveness of Swift to Android, letting you build native applications with Swift’s modern syntax, safety, and performance – all while working directly with Android’s native UI components.

Powered by [JNIKit](jni-kit/index.md), [Droid](https://github.com/swifdroid/droid), and [Swift Stream IDE](https://swift.stream), it provides a smooth workflow for writing, compiling, and deploying Swift code to Android devices.

If you’re new here, start with the [→ Setup Guide](setup/index.md), then explore the [→ Application](app/index.md) and [→ Library](lib/index.md) sections to begin building with Swift for Android.
